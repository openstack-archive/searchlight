========
Welcome!

The Searchlight project provides indexing and search capabilities across
OpenStack resources. Its goal is to achieve high performance and flexible
querying combined with near real-time indexing. It uses Elasticsearch, a
real-time distributed indexing and search engine built on Apache Lucene, but
adds OpenStack authentication and Role Based Access Control to provide
appropriate protection of data.
